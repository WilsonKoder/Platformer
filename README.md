You can play the game by download the repo as a ZIP, using the button on the side, or you can clone it to your desktop, all builds except for the MAC one are named Platform_Build. Replace platform with whatever platform you are on i.e. Linux. You can do whatever you want with this game, but you cannot take credit for it. That's a dick move.
